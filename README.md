## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Currently using hardcoded credentials for testing. In production, these should be environment variables:

- `CHATBASE_API_KEY`: Your Chatbase API key
- `CHATBOT_ID`: Your Chatbase chatbot ID

### Vercel Configuration
The `vercel.json` file includes:
- Cache prevention headers for all API routes
- Function timeout settings
- CORS configuration

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsagir/Mia_Chatbase_170825.git
   cd Mia_Chatbase_170825
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash

   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Testing
To test locally with Vercel CLI:
```bash
vercel dev
```

### API Testing with cURL
```bash
# Test chat endpoint (Production URL)
curl -X POST https://mia-chatbase-170825.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'

# Test alternative endpoint with cache-busting
curl -X POST https://mia-chatbase-170825.vercel.app/api/chat-v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'

# Check deployment status
curl https://mia-chatbase-170825.vercel.app/api/debug
```

## üìù Recent Updates

### December 25, 2024 - Latest Deployment
- ‚úÖ **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed "Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'user_id', 'user_hash'" error
- Successfully redeployed latest code from GitHub to Vercel
- Both `/api/chat` and `/api/chat-v2` endpoints are now working correctly
- Deployment confirmed at 12:33 PM (Washington, D.C., USA - iad1)

### December 17, 2024
- Removed HMAC authentication fields (`user_id`, `user_hash`) that were causing 400 errors
- Added cache-busting configuration to prevent stale deployments
- Created debug endpoint for deployment verification
- Added alternative `/api/chat-v2` endpoint with enhanced error reporting

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Unrecognized key(s)" Error (RESOLVED)
**Status: ‚úÖ Fixed as of December 25, 2024**

This error was caused by outdated deployment including `user_id` and `user_hash` fields that Chatbase doesn't recognize. The issue has been resolved by redeploying the latest code.

If you still encounter this error:
- Ensure your request only includes: `messages`, `chatbotId`, `stream`
- Try using the `/api/chat-v2` endpoint
- Check `/api/debug` to verify you're using the latest deployment

### Deployment Not Updating
1. Check deployment status at `/api/debug`
2. Use `/api/chat-v2` if `/api/chat` shows cached behavior
3. Verify `vercel.json` cache headers are present
4. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status

## üìÑ License
